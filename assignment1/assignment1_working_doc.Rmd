# (e) New air quality policy

```{r}
avg_new_lbw <- mean(df$low_birth_weight, na.rm = TRUE) - 2 * beta1_hat

lbw_ci_low <- mean(df$low_birth_weight, na.rm = TRUE) - 2 * model_pm25$conf.high[[2]]
lbw_ci_high <- mean(df$low_birth_weight, na.rm = TRUE) - 2 * model_pm25$conf.low[[2]]
```

\noindent The predicted average value of `low_birth_weight` given a reduction of 2 $\mu g / m^3$ of PM2.5 is `r avg_new_lbw`. The 95% confidence interval for this value is `r lbw_ci_low` to `r lbw_ci_high`, which means there is a 95% probability that this interval contains the true population estimate for `low_birth_weight` given a 2 $\mu g / m^3$ reduction in `pm25`
